Made Aero Fighter using CSS3, JavaScript and HTML5. I made the background move using animation in CSS3 and the plane moved up 
and down using javascript when button was clicked. I added two birds as obstacles and a spaceship as the enemy. Birds are moving
in one direction using css animation and spaceship is moving in all directions using css animation. when the plane collides with 
anything, it explodes.
